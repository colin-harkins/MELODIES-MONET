MELODIES MONET
==============

**MELODIES MONET** is a joint project between NCAR and NOAA to develop a 
modular framework that integrates existing and future diverse atmospheric 
chemistry observational datasets with chemistry model results for the 
evaluation of air quality and atmospheric composition. MELODIES MONET combines 
the Model EvaLuation using Observations, DIagnostics and Experiments Software 
(MELODIES) project at NCAR with the Model and ObservatioN Evaluation Toolkit 
(MONET) project at NOAA to develop a python diagnostic package that is open 
source, generic, portable, and model-agnostic. Overall, the project provides a 
framework for evaluating a wide range of models in a more consistent manner. 
The tool is accessible to everyone including university and national 
laboratory researchers, as well as graduate students and postdocs.

The goal is to evaluate research, operational, and regulatory models against 
a variety of observations including surface, aircraft, and satellite data all 
within a common framework. MELODIES MONET uses the functionality already 
developed by MONETIO to read in multiple observational and model datasets and 
MONET to do pairing/analysis/plotting. For more information on MONET and 
MONETIO please refer to:

.. warning::
   MELODIES MONET is currently under development. The code is public to 
   encourage collaboration amongst the community. Do not publish results using 
   MELODIES MONET without consulting the development team.
