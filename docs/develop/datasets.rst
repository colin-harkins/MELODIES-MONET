Adding New Datasets
===================

Observations
------------

Examples for how to read in data from Aeronet, AirNow, and Improve are in the
``examples/process_obs`` folder of the code on GitHub. Use these examples
as reference in order to add new surface observational datasets.

Instructions for reading in aircraft and satellite observations are under development. 

Models
------
Examples for reading model datasets can be
found in the monetio/models folder.
These include e.g., _cesm_fv_mm.py, _cmaq_mm.py, and _wrfchem_mm.py.
While a part of the monetio repository,
the MELODIES-MONET readers are designated with an _mm.

Support for additional models is also under developed.
