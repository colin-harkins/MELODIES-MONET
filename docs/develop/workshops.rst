**MELODIES MONET tutorial during the MUSICA Tutorial Series**

    March 11, 2022 - During the `MUSICA tutorial <https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/workshop/musica-tutorial-2021>`__, 
    we will demonstrate how to use MELODIES MONET to evaluate against surface 
    observations, discuss current and future development goals, and encourage 
    more collaboration with others in the community.

**Results from 2020 user survey**

A survey of the atmospheric chemistry community was conducted in Nov-Dec 2020 
to identify existing model evaluation tools and to catalog desired features of 
model-observation comparison software.  30 responses were received, with 80% 
being researchers who run models and 20% who primarily analyze observations.  
There was equal interest in using satellite retrievals, field campaign in situ 
data, and surface or ground-based networks.  The respondents included users of 
17 unique models and covered a wide range of areas of research, including air 
quality, gas-phase and aerosol chemistry, cloud interactions, marine chemistry, 
emissions inventories, data assimilation and public health. This survey 
informed development priorities.
