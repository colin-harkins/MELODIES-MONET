Evaluating Air Quality Forecasts
================================

RAP-chem
--------

Jordan Schnell at NOAA GSL is using MELODIES MONET to evaluate the performance 
of a variety of research and operational air quality forecast models 
including a newly developed research forecast model called RAP-chem every day 
in near real time against the AirNow surface observations of ozone, PM\ :sub:`2.5`\, 
CO, and NO\ :sub:`2` and AERONET AOD measurements.

Check out the full analysis for each forecast `here <https://rapidrefresh.noaa.gov/RAPchemEPA/>`__.

Example plots for ozone and PM\ :sub:`2.5` for the forecast on January 18th, 2022 
are below.
