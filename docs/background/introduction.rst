Introduction
============

The need for MELODIES (Model EvaLuation using Observations, DIagnostics 
and Experiments Software) arose when the study of atmospheric chemistry 
moved towards a unified approach. Specifically, the MUlti-scale 
Infrastructure for Chemistry and Aerosols (MUSICA) developed by the 
Atmospheric Chemistry Observations & Modeling (ACOM) Laboratory at NCAR 
simultaneously studies atmospheric composition across multiple scales. 
New models required re-writing of old-code to handle the variable 
resolution of model grids. Concurrently, measurement techniques and 
modeling are improving and becoming more complex, requiring updated 
comparisons at many different temporal, spatial and chemical scales. 
This provided an opportunity to create harmonized and consistent analysis 
tools for the atmospheric chemistry community. MELODIES is a project funded 
by NSF EarthCube that aims to address these concerns by developing a 
modular framework to compare model results and observations related to 
atmospheric chemistry. It aims to facilitate the use of diverse 
observational datasets in model evaluation. MELODIES combined with 
NOAA's MONET to leverage shared goals and development. MELODIES MONET
consists of components to manipulate both observations and model output, 
to allow for consistent quantitative comparisons with long-term and 
field intensive observations.
